    "# Cooperative Game Theory: Shapley Value and Nucleolus\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooperative game theory studies scenarios where groups of agents, called coalitions, work together to achieve a common goal and need to distribute the payoff among themselves. Two important concepts in this context are the Shapley value and the Nucleolus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shapley Value**: A method to distribute the total gains to players based on their marginal contributions.\n",
    "- **Nucleolus**: A method to distribute payoffs by minimizing the maximum dissatisfaction among the players.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will explore these concepts, provide historical context, explain the algorithms for computing them, and discuss their time complexities and improvements."

    "# Historical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shapley Value\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shapley value was introduced by Lloyd Shapley in 1953. It provides a fair distribution of payoffs based on the average marginal contributions of each player. The Shapley value has been widely studied and applied in various fields, including economics, political science, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the Shapley value for a player $i$ in a cooperative game $(N, v)$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\phi_i(v) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq N \\setminus \\{i\\}} \\frac{|S|!(|N| - |S| - 1)!}{|N|!} \\left( v(S \\cup \\{i\\}) - v(S) \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $N$ is the set of players.\n",
    "- $v$ is the value function defining the worth of each coalition.\n",
    "- $S$ is a subset of $N$ excluding player $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shapley value considers all possible orders in which the players can join a coalition and computes the marginal contribution of each player when they join the coalition. By averaging these contributions, we obtain a fair distribution of the total payoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nucleolus\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nucleolus was introduced by David Schmeidler in 1969. It focuses on minimizing the maximum dissatisfaction among players to achieve a fair distribution of payoffs. The Nucleolus is particularly useful in situations where fairness is defined by minimizing the worst-case dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the Nucleolus is the allocation $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ that lexicographically minimizes the vector of excesses $e(x, S) = v(S) - \\sum_{i \\in S} x_i$ for all coalitions $S \\subseteq N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nucleolus is found by solving a series of linear programming problems to iteratively minimize the maximum excess (dissatisfaction) for all coalitions. This process ensures that the distribution of payoffs is as fair as possible, according to the defined criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shapley value and Nucleolus are significant in cooperative game theory because they provide different yet complementary approaches to fair distribution:\n",
    "- The Shapley value is based on the principle of average marginal contributions, emphasizing individual contributions across all coalitions.\n",
    "- The Nucleolus aims to minimize dissatisfaction, focusing on equity and stability within the coalition structure.\n"

    "# Game Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the computation of Shapley and Nucleolus values independent of the specific game, we define a `Game` function. This function will describe the value of any coalition of players.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Network Communication Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we consider a network communication scenario where nodes (players) collaborate to transmit data. The value of a coalition of nodes is based on the total data they can transmit together. Each node has a certain capacity, and the total capacity of a coalition is the sum of the capacities of its members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function for an example game with five nodes is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node 1: 2 units\n",
    "- Node 2: 3 units\n",
    "- Node 3: 5 units\n",
    "- Node 4: 7 units\n",
    "- Node 5: 11 units\n",
